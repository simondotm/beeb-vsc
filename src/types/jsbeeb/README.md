# JSBeeb Typings

JSBeeb is a BBC Micro emulator written in JavaScript. This folder provides TypeScript typings for the JSBeeb API.

The typings are based on the JSBeeb API sourcecode, which can be found [here](https://githib.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb).

The typings are not complete, but they cover the basic parts of the API. If you find any issues or missing parts, please open an issue or a pull request.
